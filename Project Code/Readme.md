# JFO : JUNK FILE ORGANIZER

Hi Friends, basically my program of Junk File Organizer, I call it JFO is created specially
for lazy programmer as our desktop is full of mess and many junk files.
Due to the large number of files, it is a very difficult and time consuming task to sit and
organize each file one by one. To make that task easy the below Python code
comes handy and all the files are organized in a well-manner within
few milliseconds with just one click.

For using without any outside library installed, download this file and
use it for your benefit and ease of sorting your mess and junk from your desktop.

Main functionality of this code is mentioned below with their explanation.
```1.Organize by Extension 
2.Organize by Size  
3.Organize by Date and Time  
4.Re-Organize ordered file into Junk File as they were previously.
```So, as shown above the user will choose which method to opt for the execution of their
 junk files and organize them in the way mentioned with each selection method.

Things that going to perform in the program -
```
1. Organize by Extension:
  In this your files get organized by the means of using the file extensions 
such as if you have a text file the extension would be (.txt) same as with Image file having extension (.img,.jpg), .pdf etc.
2. Organize by size:
In this your files get organized by the means of using the Size of the file i.e., Kilobyte,
Megabytes, Gigabytes.
3. Organize by Time and Date
 In this your file get organized by using this option user can organize their files by last used date.
 random folders will be created according to files last used date and all files will be moved to folders.
4. Convert well organized file into junk file as the wording itself is very clear 
 In this your Organized File gets converted back into Junk File and all the extra folder are get deleted.
```
Please Note:
If user provide wrong path than program will ask to enter valid path for execution of the code.

# For the user who cloning the file from GitHub.
When any user who cloning the file from GitHub then for execution 
of the program he executes the main.py first after execution choices will
appear on the screen and on the basis of that choices the operation will 
be performed and the file will get organized into the path he has entered.

# Some important things used in project while making i.e., Libraries
I used many built-in libraries of python such as shutil for file movement, datetime to
get the date of the files, argparse for the command line parsing and
etc.

#Further Improvement: 
We can design an UI for the program so a normal user can easily
interact with it. We can add more features like deleting the junk files
after a certain period of time and much more.
In addition, we can add the GUI buttons and interface to look more attractive and impressive,
easy to play.


Thanks for going through my project hoping you may have liked and enjoyed it!
